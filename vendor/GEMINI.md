### Git
make a git commit after every atomic task. 

Prefer many small commits over few large commits. 

include in the git commit a flag indicating this commit was generated by gemini by prefixing with GEMINI:

After that prefix summarize the commit in one line.

Then leave a blank line and include every prompt given since the last git commit separated by blank lines.

prefix the prompt with PROMPT: 

### Workflow
follow SOLID software development principles.

prefer many small files over few large files

never run build or test commands unless explicitly told to do so

if you see comments in the code like `// GEMINI:` then ensure you follow those instructions e.g.
```
// GEMINI: do not change or remove the following line
let x = 5
```

then the line `let x = 5` should never be edited by you
